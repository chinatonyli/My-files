The Core
----------

Loongson 2F

[role="incremental"]
- Single Core

- 64-bit MIPS architecture, MIPS III instruction
  * The confusing parts when build the system:
    ** Not MIPS IV, MIPS V, or MIPS 32 +r2+, but MIPS III.
    ** Three ABIs: +O32+, +N32+, +N64+, dead +NUBI+.

- Software-controlled dynamic power management
  * 199 MHz - [line-through]#1 GHz# 796 MHz
  * 4 Walt (Max)

- Integrated DDR2 memory controller
- Extra MMX-like SIMD instruction
  * Writing optimized assmebly code for mutilmedia, graphics, etc.

- Caches
  * L1: 64 KB Instruction / 64 KB Data
  * L2: 512 KB 4-way 

- Bug


The Laptop
------------

YeeLoong 8089D

[role="incremental"]
- Loongson 2F

- 1 GB DDR2 Memory.

- 8 GB SanDisk SSD (SDPA1AA-8G)
  * CE/ZIF port, connected by a CE/ZIF -> IDE converter
  * Very slow, but almost the maximum speed of the south bridge.

- AMD CS5536 South bridge.

- SiliconMotion SM712 Graphics Card.
  * No 3D acceleration,  simple 2D acceleration.

- RTL8139 Ethernet / RTL8187B WiFi
  * Bug

- 20 Walt max.


Challege 1 - Bootloader
------------------------

PMON / PMON 2000

[role="incremental"]
- A very common firmware for MIPS evaluation boards and development systems.
  * Linksys WRT54G (hackers' love it)
  * Asus WL-300g
 
- A fork of PMON: PMON 2000
  * PMON on 8089D is Loongson's fork of PMON 2000

- Bootloader
  * No GRUB/LILO/SysLinux needed, but GRUB is loadable.

- Bugs
[role="incremental"]
  * No ext4/UFS support, even ext2 support is limited by specific block size.
  * Very slow when loading +initrd+.
  * Possible Lockup when other non-bootable device plugged in
    


boot.cfg
---------

--------------
default 0
timeout 3
showmenu 1
title GNU/Linux
        kernel (wd0,0)/boot/vmlinux-yeeloong
        initrd (wd0,0)/boot/initrd.img-yeeloong
        args root=/dev/sda1
        g  # needed in interactive console only, just like GRUB
--------------

NOTE: Use a 100 MiB ext2 partition.

NOTE: Don't use +initrd+.

NOTE: Unplugin all USB device before boot.

Linux
------

- Debian
- gNewsence
- Parabola
- Gentoo
  * Install from stage3, don't use any of stage4.
  * stage3-mipsel3_multilib-xxxxx
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD

Can't be difficult to install them.


#1: Fixup GCC

WARNING: A Bug in GCC breaks many programs.

What's wrong?

[quote, Andrew Pinski, Bugzilla]

This is a loongson2f specific bug in the back-end.  It works correctly for -march=octeon/-march=mips32/-march=mips64 .

The backend says we have conditional moves on the floating point CC modes and expands it that way but really the target says we don't and it causes the ICE.

Since it is only loongson2f only bug I am not going to fix it.  I will let the loongson maintainer fix it since I don't know what loongson2f really has when it comes to conditional moves.

Confirmed.
____

Apply the patch and rebuild gcc.


#2: Workaround the CPU Bug
--------------------------

+binutils+ has two workarounds.

* `-mfix-loongson2f-jump`
* `-mfix-loongson2f-nop`

Both of them are needed for the kernel. But for Linux, just enable +CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON2F_WORKAROUNDS+. Enable [2] for userspace program.

NOTE: Always pass `-Wa,-mfix-loongson2f-nop` to +gcc+. You had better add it to you +CFLAGS+.


#3: Fixup +rtl8187+
-------------------

.Kernel Panic after Connecting an Access Point
image:images/rtl8187-kernel-panic.jpg["Kernel Panic", width=768]

#4: Created +loongson-sources+
-------------------------------

A kernel with many patches for yeeloong 8089D users.

More RAM
--------

.a single DDR2 SODIMM slot populated with a 1GB 667mhz A-Data module.

I tried replacing it with random Hynix 2GB 667mhz module and the Yeeloong wouldn’t boot at all. I’ve contacted the vendor to ask if it’s possible to upgrade the Yeeloong at all, and if so, if any requirements need to be met.

In the meantime I received a mail from Gilbert Fernandes who informed me that the memory in the Yeeloong should always be single rank (most typical 2GB modules aren’t).

Fixup PMON
-----------

* Boot Lockups
* Low Speed +initrd+ Loading
* Support ext4

But it can't be done without a EEPROM programmer. I'll buy one next week.

Implementing the (correct) 2D acceleration
------------------------------------------

NetBSD has a implementation. may help.

Debugging +xf86-video-siliconmotion+
-------------------------------------

Using SSH? No.

Resyncing the decoder written in assmebly for LibAV/FFmpeg
-----------------------------------------------------------

I don't know LibAV build system well. I can not link them...

Others
-------

Remove `march=loongson2f` fix it. Really a problem?
