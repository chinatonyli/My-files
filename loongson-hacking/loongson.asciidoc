The Core
---------

.Loongson 2F
[caption=""]
image::images/loongson-2f.jpg["Loongson 2F CPU", width=256, float="right"]

[role="incremental"]
- Single Core

- 64-bit MIPS architecture, MIPS III instruction
  * The confused parts when build the system:
    ** Not MIPS IV, MIPS V, or MIPS 32 +r2+, but MIPS III.
    ** Three ABIs: +O32+, +N32+, +N64+, dead +NUBI+.

- Software-controlled dynamic power management
  * 199 MHz - [line-through]#1 GHz# 796 MHz
  * 4 W (Max)

- Integrated DDR2 memory controller
- Extra MMX-like SIMD instruction
  * Writing optimized assmebly code for mutilmedia, graphics, etc.

- Caches
  * L1: 64 KB Instruction / 64 KB Data
  * L2: 512 KB 4-way

- Bug


The Laptop
------------

.YeeLoong 8089D
[caption=""]
image::images/8089d.jpg["YeeLoong 8089D", width=300, float="right"]

[role="incremental"]
- Loongson 2F

- No Proprietary Firmwares

- 1 GB DDR2 Memory.

- 8 GB SanDisk SSD (SDPA1AA-8G)
  * CE/ZIF port, connected by a CE/ZIF -> IDE converter
  * Very slow, but almost the maximum speed of the south bridge.

- AMD CS5536 South bridge.
  * Internal 80-wire IDE.

- SiliconMotion SM712 Graphics Card.
  * No 3D acceleration, simple 2D acceleration.

- RTL8139 Ethernet / RTL8187B WiFi
  * Bug

- 20 W max.


BIOS/Bootloader
----------------

PMON / PMON 2000

[role="incremental"]

- A very common firmware for MIPS evaluation boards and development systems.
  * Linksys WRT54G (hackers' love it)
  * Asus WL-300g

- A fork of PMON: PMON 2000
  * PMON on 8089D is Loongson's fork of PMON 2000

- Bootloader
  * No GRUB/LILO/SysLinux needed, but GRUB is loadable.

- Bugs
[role="incremental"]
  * No ext4/UFS support, even ext2 support is limited by specific block size.
  * Very slow when loading +initrd+.
  * Possible Lockup when other non-bootable device plugged in

- Free Software
  * BSD License


boot.cfg
---------

--------------
default 0
timeout 3
showmenu 1
title GNU/Linux
    kernel (wd0,0)/boot/vmlinux-yeeloong
    initrd (wd0,0)/boot/initrd.img-yeeloong
    args root=/dev/sda1
    g <1>
--------------

<1> It is needed in interactive console only, just like +boot+ in GRUB.

[NOTE]
.Avoid Problems
================================
* Use a 100 MiB ext2 partition.
* Don't use +initrd+.
* Unplugin all USB device before boot.
================================

Linux
------

Installing them is not difficult :)

- Debian
- gNewsence
- Parabola
- Gentoo
  * Install from stage3, don't use any of stage4.
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD

NOTE: +stage3-mipsel3+ is the correct Gentoo stage3 for Loongson 2F.


#1: Fixup GCC
-------------

.#58158
--------------
error: unrecognizable insn:
 DEFINE_SQUARE (int16, 32767.0);
 ^
(insn 106 105 107 8 (set (reg:SI 284)
        (if_then_else:SI (ne:CC (reg:CC 67 $fcc0)

            (reg:SI 251 [ iftmp.184 ]))) -1
     (nil))
internal compiler error: in extract_insn
----------------

WARNING: Don't use GCC 4.8 without the patch.

What's wrong?

[quote, Andrew Pinski, Bugzilla]
____
This is a loongson2f specific bug in the back-end.  It works correctly for -march=octeon/-march=mips32/-march=mips64 .

The backend says we have conditional moves on the floating point CC modes and expands it that way but really the target says we don't and it causes the ICE.

Since it is only loongson2f only bug I am not going to fix it.  I will let the loongson maintainer fix it since I don't know what loongson2f really has when it comes to conditional moves.

Confirmed.
____

Apply the patch and rebuild gcc.


#2: Workaround the CPU Bug
--------------------------

+binutils+ has two workarounds.

* `-mfix-loongson2f-jump`
* `-mfix-loongson2f-nop`

Both of them are needed for the kernel. But for Linux, just enable +CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON2F_WORKAROUNDS+. Enable [2] for userspace program.

NOTE: Always pass `-Wa,-mfix-loongson2f-nop` to +gcc+. You had better add it to you +CFLAGS+.


#3: Fixup +rtl8187+
-------------------

.Kernel Panic after Connecting an Access Point
image:images/rtl8187-kernel-panic.jpg["Kernel Panic", width=512]

+rtl8187+ is broken on MIPS since Linux 3.8.

+git bisect+
-------------

[quote, Stanislaw Gruszka, https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54391]
________
There are only 3 changes on rtl8187 between 3.7 and 3.8 version.

-----------
[stasiu@localhost linux]$ git log --pretty=oneline v3.7..v3.8
-- drivers/net/wireless/rtl818x/
fd549f1 rtl8187: remove __dev* attributes
fb4e899 rtl8187: remove __dev* attributes
f4bda33 support RX_FLAG_MACTIME_END
-----------

None of them can be responsible for this bug. This seems to be problem in other subsystem like USB or network. The only way to move this bug forward is probably bisection.

[role="incremental"]
- Disabled many useless kernel features
- Genpatches
- BFQ
- UKSM
- CJKtty

More RAM
--------

.a single DDR2 SODIMM slot populated with a 1GB 667mhz A-Data module.

[quote, Pascal de Bruijn, https://encrypted.pcode.nl/blog]
_____
I tried replacing it with random Hynix 2GB 667mhz module and the Yeeloong wouldn’t boot at all. I’ve contacted the vendor to ask if it’s possible to upgrade the Yeeloong at all, and if so, if any requirements need to be met.

In the meantime I received a mail from Gilbert Fernandes who informed me that the memory in the Yeeloong should always be single rank (most typical 2GB modules aren’t).

Fixup PMON
-----------

* Boot Lockups
* Low Speed +initrd+ Loading
* Support ext4

But it can't be done without a EEPROM programmer. I'll buy one next week.

Fixup 2D acceleration
----------------------

[quote]
______________
It may make the whole system hang when scrolling the screen, for example, if we
 copy some files from another machines to yeeloong via scp and the screeoutput
is enabled, the whole system may hang.
______________

So, the 2D acceleration had been removed.

TIP: NetBSD/OpenBSD have a elegant implementation.

Others
-------

- Debug +xf86-video-siliconmotion+
  * It is always freeze and lockup the whole system including kernel, and/or cause kernel panic.

TIP: There is a serial port on the motherboard. But it seems unusable without soldering.

- Resync the decoder written in assmebly for latest LibAV/FFmpeg.
  * I don't know LibAV build system well. I can not link the assmebly code successfully...

- Fixup Webkit.
  * Can't get rid of +segfault+ now.

- Fixup Virtualenv.
  * Virtualenv is unusable on Gentoo MIPS N32, preventing us to build Firefox.

- More things need to fix.
  * I forgot them.


Thanks
